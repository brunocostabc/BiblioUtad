## Description 📑
BiblioUTAD is a university library management web application developed as part of a Web Engineering project at the University of Trás-os-Montes and Alto Douro (UTAD). 📚

The platform is designed to streamline the management of a library, providing tailored features for Readers, Librarians, and Administrators. Users can browse the book catalog, request books, and manage loans, while librarians and administrators have access to powerful tools for catalog and user management. 🏛️

The system supports book reservations with a 15-day return policy, automatic notifications for overdue books, and secure user authentication and role-based access control. It also includes administrative tools for managing users, blocking accounts, and monitoring library statistics. 🔐

Developed using ASP.NET Core MVC, SQL Server, and modern web technologies, BiblioUTAD combines functionality with a user-friendly interface, ensuring an efficient and intuitive library experience. 💻

This project was created by me as part of a Web Engineering course in the 2024/2025 academic year. I hope you find it useful! 📖
